Devastatingly powerful, wild mages believe the attempts of others to codify and define magic is a useless pursuit that can end only in failure. Instead, wild mages seek out what they consider magic in its purest form, accepting the risks that come along with wild magic in exchange for the chance to realize even more power in the random chance of a single spell. Like other chaos sorcerers, wild mages draw their power from the entropic power of the <#454483160705662987> , which they may gain through unusually potent exposure to the forces that run there, such as through birth on one such plane."},"454747986279268402":{"u":15,"t":1528490768738,"m":"**Culture**\nWhile all arcane spellcasters accept the fact that magic is a powerful and often unpredictable force, most believe that through the proper training and diligence it is something that one can learn to control. Wild mages, however, reject this precept, believing instead that controlling arcane magic is a futile goal that only limits one's potential to preconceived ideas of order. Instead, wild mages embrace the randomness of unrefined wild magic, channeling it through their bodies like an electrical current, rather than trying to contain or control it. In many cases, this gives wild mages a degree of power uncommon to other mages.

Early in their descent into the path of a wild mage, chaos sorcerers obtain the ability to, in a moment of stress or urgency, use the effects of wild magic to suddenly exact a random effect, such as turning invisible, teleport, increase their vitality or resistance to dangerous energies, or throw off ill effects. Around the same time, wild mages also enhance their natural ability to change the winds of fortune to their favor, making even a failed attack useful in some manner or even allowing it to hit the foe it apparently \"missed.\" With a greater degree of training in the use of wild magic, wild mages become more attuned to the forces with which they work, allowing them to deal deadlier blows with their spells."},"454748586534633474":{"u":15,"t":1528490911850,"m":"","a":[{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/454745720541675530/454748586006282245/unknown.png"}]}},"454667433043558410":{"454727555925278721":{"u":15,"t":1528485897762,"m":"**Drenconax**, also known as the Eternal Flame, is a powerful demon lord and lesser deity.
